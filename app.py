    Culture fit assessment involves evaluating candidate alignment with company culture based on explicit statements in the job description and candidate documents.
    Analyze both the job description and the candidate's documents to identify values in categories like Company Culture, Team Dynamics, Work Environment, Personal Values, Management Style, Diversity & Inclusion.
    Output Format:
    - Category
    - Statement
    - Source
    - Context
    - Relevance Score (1-5)
    Scoring: Provide Best Fit, Average Fit, or Poor Fit based on alignment with the company's core values and expectations.
